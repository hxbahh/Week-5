//A router is a way to handle specific paths in a separate file. It helps in grouping related routes and makes the code more organized

// Why use it?

// We split routes into separate files to keep our code neat and easy to manage
// instead of putting everything in one big file, we create small files for each part like students.js, products.js, etc...
// This makes the project easier to read and grow in the future
