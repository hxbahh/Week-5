// WHAT IS NODE JS

// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that run JavaScript on the server side not just in the browser. it helps build backend applications, APIs, and servers.
//  it’s fast and efficient bcz it’s built on Chrome’s V8 engine


// KEY FEATURES OF NODE.JS

// 1. RUNS JAVASCRIPT OUTSIDE THE BROWSER

// Node.js allows to use JavaScript on the server side, not just in the browser.
// Great for building backend applications.


// 2. ASYNCHRONOUS AND NON-BLOCKING

// Node.js handles multiple tasks at the same time without waiting.
// This makes it fast and efficient, especially for APIs and real-time apps.


// 3. BUILT ON V8 JAVASCRIPT ENGINE

// It uses Google Chrome’s V8 engine to run JavaScript very fast.
// This improves performance and speed.


// 4. SINGLE-THREADED BUT HIGHLY SCALABLE

// Node.js uses one thread to handle many users at once using events and callbacks.
// This helps it manage thousands of requests without crashing.


// 5. NPM (NODE PACKAGE MANAGER)

// Comes with a powerful tool called npm to install open-source libraries.
// Makes development faster with ready-to-use packages.
